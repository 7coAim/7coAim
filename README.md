### Profile

I majored in industrial administration at Tokyo University of Science.

After graduating from university, I joined a major system development company.
As a system engineer (SE), I engaged in proof-of-concept and system development for government-affiliated financial institutions and central ministries.

After that, I changed my job to a Japanese B2B SaaS company and I am working on web application development, engineering management, and project management every day.
